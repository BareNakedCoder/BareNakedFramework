Super simple and lightweight.\r\n\r\n* Route to the application code as fast as possible\r\n  * Load as few PHP files as possible (in prod mode, just 2!)\r\n  * Load and interpret as few (often unused) lines of PHP code as possible\r\n* Enable switch-over deploys\r\n  * Install, some final testing, then a simple switch-over without needing to shutdown\r\n  * Problems? Simply switch-back to the previous code (it's still installed)\r\n* Enable framework upgrades: just plug-in the newer BNF part(s)\r\n  * Enable pluggable parts for composite web sites\r\n  * Just plug-in apps, sub-apps, other apps, libs, and even non-BNF parts\r\n* Above all, be fast and lean before trying to be feature rich (YAGNI).\r\n  * Avoid regular expressions, excessive OOP, etc.\r\n\r\nDon Parakin, BareNakedCoder.com\r\n\r\n## Coming Soon! Code Cleanup In-Progress","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
